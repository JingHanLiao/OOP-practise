Prefix to Infix

Write a program that reads prefix expressions and converts them to infix. The infix expressions should be fully parenthesized to show the order of application of the operators. Each prefix expression should be entered on a separate line. The program should keep reading prefix expressions and converting them to infix until a blank line is entered.

For example:

| Input                     | Output                                |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| \*/+785+4-93 <br> -+12+45 | ((7+8)/5)\*(4+(9-3)) <br> (1+2)-(4+5) |
