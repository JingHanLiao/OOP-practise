Box of Balls

Design a class representing a box of balls of varied sizes.

The class should have two private data members, one for storing the number of balls and the other declaring a dynamic array for diameter of each ball.

The class should have a parameterized. constructor to initialize the number of balls and the radius of each ball, and a destructor to deallocate memory when the objects are destroyed.

It should also have member functions to input data members and to display the volume of each ball.

demonstrate the class in a program.

Note that pi =3.1416

INPUT

For each test, the first integer N is the number of balls, it follows by N doubles which are the radius of each ball.

OUTPUT

Each test output the volume of each ball to four decimal places in one line.

For example:

| Input           | Output                                    |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 5 1 2.3 3 4 5.5 | 4.1888 50.9651 113.0976 268.0832 696.9116 |
